📊 Project Overview
Indian General Elections are influenced by multiple factors like:

Criminal records of candidates

Educational background

Caste and religion demographics

Past voting trends

Voter turnout rate

This project aims to:

Analyze past voting behavior over multiple election years.

Train a Random Forest Classifier to predict party victory in a constituency.

Help identify patterns in voter preferences using time-series data.

🧠 Machine Learning Technique
Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

Why Random Forest? It provides robustness, handles feature importance, and reduces overfitting compared to decision trees.

🛠️ Features and Tools
Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used:

pandas, numpy – Data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization

sklearn – ML algorithms & preprocessing

Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

📁 Dataset Details
Source: Publicly available electoral datasets (e.g., data.gov.in)

Features Used:

Year-wise constituency data

Candidate and party information

Voter turnout

Criminal and education details of candidates

Demographic statistics

📈 Results and Analysis
Model Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of ~85% on test data.

Feature Importance: Criminal records and educational qualifications ranked among the top influential features.

Insights:

Urban constituencies showed more volatility in voting patterns.

Higher education levels correlated with lower criminal record influence.

📚 Future Scope
Incorporate social media sentiment analysis.

Expand dataset to include assembly elections for granular analysis.

Use advanced time series models like ARIMA or LSTM for sequential predictio
